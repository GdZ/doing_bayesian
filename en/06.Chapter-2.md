The goal of this chapter is to introduce the conceptual framework of Bayesian data analysis. Bayesian data analysis has two foundational ideas. The first idea is that Bayesian inference is reallocation of credibility across possibilities. The second foundational idea is that the possibilities, over which we allocate credibility, are parameter values in meaningful mathematical models. These two fundamental ideas form the conceptual foundation for every analysis in this book. Simple examples of these ideas are presented in this chapter. The rest of the book merely fills in the mathematical and computational details for specific applications of these two ideas. This chapter also explains the basic procedural steps shared by every Bayesian analysis.

> $^1$ This chapter introduces ideas of mathematical models, credibility of parameter values, and the semantics of models. The poem plays with the words “model,” “believe,” and “true” in an everyday context, and hints that Bayesian methods (personified) may be someone to believe in. (And yes, grammatically, the first line should be “in whom I can believe,” but the poem is supposed to be colloquial speech. Besides, the grammatically correct version is iambic not dactylic!)



### 2.1. BAYESIAN INFERENCE IS REALLOCATION OF CREDIBILITY ACROSS POSSIBILITIES

Suppose we step outside one morning and notice that the sidewalk is wet, and wonder why. We consider all possible causes of the wetness, including possibilities such as recent rain, recent garden irrigation, a newly erupted underground spring, a broken sewage pipe, a passerby who spilled a drink, and so on. If all we know until this point is that some part of the sidewalk is wet, then all those possibilities will have some prior credibility based on previous knowledge. For example, recent rain may have greater prior probability than a spilled drink from a passerby. Continuing on our outside journey, we look around and collect new observations. If we observe that the sidewalk is wet for as far as we can see, as are the trees and parked cars, then we re-allocate credibility to the hypothetical cause of recent rain. The other possible causes, such as a passerby spilling a drink, would not account for the new observations. On the other hand, if instead we observed that the wetness was localized to a small area, and there was an empty drink cup a few feet away, then we would re-allocate credibility to the spilled-drink hypothesis, even though it had relatively low prior probability. This sort of reallocation of credibility across possibilities is the essence of Bayesian inference.

Another example of Bayesian inference has been immortalized in the words of the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes, who often said to his sidekick, Doctor Watson: “How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?” (Doyle, 1890, chap. 6) Although this reasoning was not described by Holmes or Watson or Doyle as Bayesian inference, it is. Holmes conceived of a set of possible causes for a crime. Some of the possibilities may have seemed very improbable, a priori. Holmes systematically gathered evidence that ruled out a number of the possible causes. If all possible causes but one were eliminated, then (Bayesian) reasoning forced him to conclude that the remaining possible cause was fully credible, even if it seemed improbable at the start.

Figure 2.1 illustrates Holmes’ reasoning. For the purposes of illustration, we suppose that there are just four possible causes of the outcome to be explained. We label the causes A, B, C, and D. The heights of the bars in the graphs indicate the credibility of the candidate causes. (“Credibility” is synonymous with “probability”; here I use the everyday term “credibility” but later in the book, when mathematical formalisms are introduced, I will also use the term “probability.”) Credibility can range from zero to one. If the credibility of a candidate cause is zero, then the cause is definitely not responsible. If the credibility of a candidate cause is one, then the cause definitely is responsible. Because we assume that the candidate causes are mutually exclusive and exhaust all possible causes, the total credibility across causes sums to one.

The upper-left panel of Figure 2.1 shows that the prior credibilities of the four candidate causes are equal, all at 0.25. Unlike the case of the wet sidewalk, in which prior knowledge suggested that rain may be a more likely cause than a newly erupted underground spring, the present illustration assumes equal prior credibilities of the candidate causes. Suppose we make new observations that rule out candidate cause A. For example, if A is a suspect in a crime, we may learn that A was far from the crime scene at the time. Therefore, we must re-allocate credibility to the remaining candidate causes, B through D, as shown in the lower-left panel of Figure 2.1. The re-allocated distribution of credibility is called the posterior distribution because it is what we believe after taking into account the new observations. The posterior distribution gives zero credibility to cause A, and allocates credibilities of 0.33 (i.e., 1/3) to candidate causes B, C, and D.

The posterior distribution then becomes the prior beliefs for subsequent observations. Thus, the prior distribution in the upper-middle of Figure 2.1 is the posterior distribution from the lower left. Suppose now that additional new evidence rules out candidate cause B. We now must re-allocate credibility to the remaining candidate causes, C and D, as shown in the lower-middle panel of Figure 2.1. This posterior distribution becomes the prior distribution for subsequent data collection, as shown in the upper-right panel of Figure 2.1. Finally, if new data rule out candidate cause C, then all credibility must fall on the remaining cause, D, as shown in the lower-right panel of Figure 2.1, just as Holmes declared. This reallocation of credibility is not only intuitive, it is also what the exact mathematics of Bayesian inference prescribe, as will be explained later in the book.

> Figure 2.1 The upper-left graph shows the credibilities of the four possible causes for an outcome. The causes, labeled A, B, C, and D, are mutually exclusive and exhaust all possibilities. The causes happen to be equally credible at the outset; hence all have prior credibility of 0.25. The lower-left graph shows the credibilities when one cause is learned to be impossible.The resulting posterior distribution is used as the prior distribution in the middle column, where another cause is learned to be impossible. The posterior distribution from the middle column is used as the prior distribution for the right column. The remaining possible cause is fully implicated by Bayesian reallocation of credibility.

The complementary form of reasoning is also Bayesian, and can be called judicial exoneration. Suppose there are several possible culprits for a crime, and that these suspects are mutually unaffiliated and exhaust all possibilities. If evidence accrues that one suspect is definitely culpable, then the other suspects are exonerated.

This form of exoneration is illustrated in Figure 2.2. The upper panel assumes that there are four possible causes for an outcome, labeled A, B, C, and D. We assume that the causes are mutually exclusive and exhaust all possibilities. In the context of suspects for a crime, the credibility of the hypothesis that suspect A committed the crime is the culpability of the suspect. So it might be easier in this context to think of culpability instead of credibility. The prior culpabilities of the four suspects are, for this illustration, set to be equal, so the four bars in the upper panel of Figure 2.2 are all of height 0.25. Suppose that new evidence firmly implicates suspect D as the culprit. Because the other suspects are known to be unaffiliated, they are exonerated, as shown in the lower panel of Figure 2.2. As in the situation of Holmesian deduction, this exoneration is not only intuitive, it is also what the exact mathematics of Bayesian inference prescribe, as will be explained later in the book.

#### 2.1.1. Data are noisy and inferences are probabilistic

The cases of Figures 2.1 and 2.2 assumed that observed data had definitive, deterministic relations to the candidate causes. For example, the fictional Sherlock Holmes may have found a footprint at the scene of the crime and identified the size and type of shoe with complete certainty, thereby completely ruling out or implicating a particular candidate suspect. In reality, of course, data have only probabilistic relations to their underlying causes. A real detective might carefully measure the footprint and the details of its tread, but these measurements would only probabilistically narrow down the range of possible shoes that might have produced the print. The measurements are not perfect, and the footprint is only an imperfect representation of the shoe that produced it. The relation between the cause (i.e., the shoe) and the measured effect (i.e., the footprint) is full of random variation.

In scientific research, measurements are replete with randomness. Extraneous influences contaminate the measurements despite tremendous efforts to limit their intrusion. For example, suppose we are interested in testing whether a new drug reduces blood pressure in humans. We randomly assign some people to a test group that takes the drug, and we randomly assign some other people to a control group that takes a placebo. The procedure is “double blind” so that neither the participants nor the administrators know which person received the drug or the placebo (because that information is indicated by a randomly assigned code that is decrypted after the data are collected). We measure the participants’ blood pressures at set times each day for several days. As you can imagine, blood pressures for any single person can vary wildly depending on many influences, such as exercise, stress, recently eaten foods, etc. The measurement of blood pressure is itself an uncertain process, as it depends on detecting the sound of blood flow under a pressurized sleeve. Blood pressures are also very different from one person to the next. The resulting data, therefore, are extremely messy, with tremendous variability within each group, and tremendous overlap across groups. Thus, there will be many measured blood pressures in the drug group that are higher than blood pressures in the placebo group, and vice versa. From these two dispersed and overlapping heaps of numbers, we want to infer how big a difference there is between the groups, and how certain we can be about that difference. The problem is that for any particular real difference between the drug and the placebo, its measurable effect is only a random impression.
